* TODO install magit
p   magit    - Emacs interface for Git
* TODO [#A] List session manager needs
  - per user window manager settings
  - maybe the ability to remember the last loaded environment per user
    like kdm does
  - ability to switch from a user session to another one, like kdm
    does.
  - ability to _easily_ see and select your window manager. Maybe with
    a displayable menu? Make usage of dmenu calls?
  - ability to halt the machine, from with the window manager without
    typing the root password.
* TODO [#A] [42%] choose a new session manager
  $ aptitude search ~Px-display-manager
  p   gdm                            - Gestionnaire d'écran de connexion de GNOME
  p   gdm3                           - gestionnaire de sessions GDM
  i A kdm                            - gestionnaire d'écran de connexion de KDE pour X11
  p   lightdm                        - simple display manager
  i   slim                           - desktop-independent graphical login manager for X11
  p   wdm                            - Gestionnaire d'affichage WINGs, un remplaçant à xdm avec l'apparence de WindowMaker
  i   xdm                            - X display manager

  - [ ] xdm - Very light. Still I need to understand how to switch from
    one user to another. I need to learn how to start a window manager
    depending on the logged user.
  - [ ] slim - Quite a good one. Some tweaking needs to be done to satisfy
    my needs. I want users to be able to halt the machine. I want it
    to load the right window manager regarding the user logged in.
  - [X] kdm - This one is a hurdle as it starts some kde related process
    which stays open while awesome is running.
  - [X] gdm - This one may present the same problems as the previous one
    (kde) and I want my setup as light as possible. I don't want to
    leave kde to end up with gnome.
  - [X] gdm3 - Same as above
  - [ ] lightdm - not tested yet (debian testing)
  - [ ] wdm - not tested yet (debian testing)
* TODO [#B] list needed features
** DONE [#B] move client around tags
   CLOSED: [2013-01-10 jeu. 19:11]
** TODO [#B] tile client to left or right (the client takes half the surface of
    the screen and is glued to the left or the right of the screen)
** TODO [#B] maximize a client and unmaximize the client to its previous size
    (do I really need unmaximize?)
** TODO [#B] have a 2D layout:
    | 1 | 2 | 3 |
    | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   - This can be mimicked by have a mod4 + down and mod4 + up which
     move to 3 tags right and 3 tags left.
** TODO [#B] have named tag associated to context: dev, web, chat, mail,
    compilation, sandbox
    | dev  | compilation | web  |
    | mail | sandbox     | chat |
** TODO [#B] have a goto named tag: goto dev (could this behave like the
    promptbox?), Do I want to type the name of my tag (or an
    acronym) or only bind each tag moveto action on a key for each
    of them.
** TODO [#B] do I want clients to go over the clock or not?
** TODO [#B] two clocks (UTC and CET) with different colors (maybe orange and
    standard grey respectively)
** TODO [#B] automatically add my dev emacs to the dev tag. automatically
    add my chatty emacs to the chatty tag. Is this even possible?
    Find a way to differentiate them
** TODO [#B] have a bind to display the name of the song currently playing in
    the launcher for instance.
** TODO [#C] ps aux widget. I often open a terminal and type ps aux | grep
    mybugged_program_name. It may be cool to have a promptbox like
    widget to do this and display it on the desktop with maybe a
    time-life of 10 seconds or have the ability to close the ps widget
    with one key like Q and mimic less, more and most behavior.
** TODO [#C] have a way to display all my clients on the same tag but as
    - thumbs and filter the view them by typing letters found in the
      client names. Select on client among the displayed one maybe
      with the help of arrows. Have one of the clients highlighted
      (use client.focus?)
    - I may be able to do this with the shifty library. I tag all my
      clients with a tag map and move to this new tag. Then focus in a
      promptbox and filter by typing letters. Update the map tag
      whenever I strike key. One problem remain: create thumbs. or
      maybe I could simply tile all the client on that specific map
      tag.
* TODO [#B] find out why my .xsession is not processed correctly
  I want setxkbmap fr bepo at startup
