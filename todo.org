* TODO [#A] list needed features
** DONE [#B] move client around tags
   CLOSED: [2013-01-10 jeu. 19:11]
** TODO [#B] tile client to left or right (the client takes half the surface of
    the screen and is glued to the left or the right of the screen)
** TODO [#B] maximize a client and unmaximize the client to its previous size
    (do I really need unmaximize?)
** TODO [#B] have a 2D layout:
    | 1 | 2 | 3 |
    | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   - This can be mimicked by have a mod4 + down and mod4 + up which
     move to 3 tags right and 3 tags left.
** TODO [#B] have named tag associated to context: dev, web, chat, mail,
    compilation, sandbox
    | dev  | compilation | web  |
    | mail | sandbox     | chat |
** TODO [#B] have a goto named tag: goto dev (could this behave like the
    promptbox?), Do I want to type the name of my tag (or an
    acronym) or only bind each tag moveto action on a key for each
    of them.
** TODO [#C] ps aux widget. I often open a terminal and type ps aux | grep
    mybugged_program_name. It may be cool to have a promptbox like
    widget to do this and display it on the desktop with maybe a
    time-life of 10 seconds or have the ability to close the ps widget
    with one key like Q and mimic less, more and most behavior.
** TODO [#B] do I want clients to go over the clock or not?
** TODO [#B] two clocks (UTC and CET) with different colors (maybe orange and
    standard grey respectively)
** TODO [#B] automatically add my dev emacs to the dev tag. automatically
    add my chatty emacs to the chatty tag. Is this even possible?
    Find a way to differentiate them
** TODO [#B] have a bind to display the name of the song currently playing in
    the launcher for instance.
** TODO [#C] have a way to display all my clients on the same tag but as
    - thumbs and filter the view them by typing letters found in the
      client names. Select on client among the displayed one maybe
      with the help of arrows. Have one of the clients highlighted
      (use client.focus?)
    - I may be able to do this with the shifty library. I tag all my
      clients with a tag map and move to this new tag. Then focus in a
      promptbox and filter by typing letters. Update the map tag
      whenever I strike key. One problem remain: create thumbs. or
      maybe I could simply tile all the client on that specific map
      tag.
* TODO [#B] find out why my .xsession is not processed correctly
  I want setxkbmap fr bepo at startup
